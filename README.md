# Trading
This is a repository for storing trade ideas, positions and trade research so it's not lost in my computer or in my head. 

The idea here is to record my complete multi-level systematic process for generating high quality trade ideas with a 20-60 day time horizon with deep quantitative and qualitative analysis.

If it's public, it's now real. Versus it just being stored and lost in various files on my laptop.
